CLKC-30#1 Advisory
MMCME4 not driven by IO has BUFG in feedback loop  
The MMCME4 cell pl_top_m1/PLL_m1/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst has a BUFGCE pl_top_m1/PLL_m1/inst/clkf_buf clock buffer in the feedback loop, but the clock input is not directly driven by an I/O to create a Zero Delay Buffer Clock (a common use for having a buffer in the feedback loop). If there is no specific need for this buffer in the feedback loop (e.g. no timing paths between CLKINx/CLKOUTx domains or low latency requirement), then it is suggested to remove that BUFG* from the feedback path. This will allow for a lower power solution and free the clock resource for other purposes.
